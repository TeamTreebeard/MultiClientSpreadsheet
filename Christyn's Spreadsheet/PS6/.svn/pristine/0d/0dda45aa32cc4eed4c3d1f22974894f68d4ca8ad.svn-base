10/26 - 10/27 -- Got held up with references. 
10/28/2014   --  Weird issue with SpreadsheetPanel.. throwing a null reference exception. No one seems to know what's wrong and I've
				 restarted the project about 5 times, same issue. Waiting til I can attend TA hours. 

10/31/2014	--	 TA didn't know what was wrong but on the 10th, yes 10th, restart it somehow worked. Still have no idea what was wrong.
				 at least I can start now.

				 Most of it done. WANTING TO ADD THEMES. Can't figure out how to do it though since I would need to edit
				 SpreadsheetPanel directly...

				 Need to finish doing tests for the GUI
11/1/2014	--	 Pretty much given up on themes, no way to change it unless I can either make multiple panels and switch, but 
				 every time I try to make a project for it I get that null reference thing I got when I was originally starting.

				 Also can't seem to change the constructor for Spreadsheet Panel. Might have something to do with User Control?
				 Unfamiliar with that so I'd have to read up.

				 ADD-ONS TO SPREADSHEET: Arrow key movement and use of "Return" key for the "Enter" button on the spreadsheet.

				 For some reason Coded UI Tester doesn't register arrow keys as what it is supposed to do. It says I'm entering it into the text box
				 SO arrow keys work like they should but I CAN'T get code coverage as far as I've been able to tell. Also can't find the code to edit.. but
				 I will have to wait until another day to figure that out.

				 SOOOO. If I run certain tests on THIS computer, everything works but when I try it on
				 any other computer they don't work. My only guess is something is wrong with my references
				 or they aren't transferring right or something.... I don't know ._.
